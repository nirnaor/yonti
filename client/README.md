The app is a standard [Marionette](http://marionettejs.com/) application.

Build the package
```sh
$ npm run build
```
Start the server
```sh
$ npm start
```
Play the game
```sh
$ npm run game
```


#### Build for mobile
I used cordova in order to build the app for mobile platforms. Currently ios and android are supported. 

To build for ios and **automatically run the emulator** you can simply:

```sh
grunt build_ios
```
or
```sh
grunt build_android
```
