# Yonti

Yonti is a memory game for students. It is intended to help students memory phrases befor their tests.

Build the package
```sh
$ npm run build
```
Start the server
```sh
$ npm run server
```
Play the game
```sh
$ npm run game
```


#### Build for mobile
I used cordova in order to build the app for mobile platforms. Currently ios and android are supported. 

To build for ios and **automatically run the emulator** you can simply:

```sh
grunt build_ios
```
or
```sh
grunt build_android
```
